  - `@react-native-firebase/crashlytics` → Crash reporting and monitoring
- TanStack Query (React Query) → Cache/Sync Firestore server state
- Zustand (global state) → Local/Client app state only
- React Hook Form (forms)
- Zod (validation)
- Expo Secure Store (secure local storage)
- NativeWind (only if styling requested)

---

## 💰 Domain Context: Spendro - Expense Manager App

**App Name:** Spendro (AI-powered Expense Tracker)

The app includes:

- Expense tracking (manual + AI-assisted)
- Income tracking
- Budget planning
- Category-wise analytics
- Monthly reports
- AI insights (spending behavior analysis)
- Receipt scanning (optional)
- Multi-currency support
- Offline-first support (Firestore offline persistence + basic caching)
- Onboarding flow for new users
- Unified auth screen (Login/Signup with tab toggle)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Rules

### 1. Expo First Approach (Development Build Required)

Always prefer Expo modules before custom native libraries, but since we are using **React Native Firebase**, a standard **Expo Go** environment will not work.
- **You MUST use Expo Development Builds (`expo-dev-client`)** to run and test the app.
- Never suggest Expo Go for testing Firebase features.

Other Expo Modules in use:
- expo-camera → receipt capture
- expo-image-picker → receipts
- expo-file-system → storage
- expo-secure-store → sensitive local data
- expo-notifications → reminders

---

### 2. Project Structure (Mandatory)

```

---

### 3. UI Components - Required Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` instead of raw `Text` and `View` components. These ensure consistent theming across light and dark modes.

```tsx
import { ThemedText } from "@/components/themed-text";
import { ThemedView } from "@/components/themed-view";

// ThemedText types: 'default' | 'title' | 'small' | 'smallBold' | 'subtitle' | 'link' | 'linkPrimary' | 'code'
// ThemedView type: accepts 'background' | 'backgroundElement' | etc from theme colors

<ThemedView style={styles.container}>
  <ThemedText type="title">Hello</ThemedText>
  <ThemedText type="small">Subtitle</ThemedText>
</ThemedView>;
```

---

### 4. Reusable Auth Components

The app includes reusable auth components in `/components/`:

- **AuthToggle** - Switch between Login/Signup tabs
- **AuthTextInput** - Reusable input with icon, label, and optional password toggle
- Both use `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` for consistency

---

### 5. Feature-Based Architecture

Each feature module under `features/` must contain:

- UI components
- Database service operations (via Firestore wrapper)
- Custom hooks (for TanStack Query or Firestore subscriptions)
- Types
- Validation schemas (Zod)

---

### 6. Data Layer Rules (Firebase Auth & Firestore)

- **NEVER call Firebase/Firestore SDKs directly inside components.** All operations must go through service files and custom hooks.
- **NEVER use Axios or REST API endpoints.** Replace all API client code with React Native Firebase SDK calls.
- **Use TanStack Query (React Query) for managing Firestore server state** (fetching, caching, updates).
  - Queries → Fetch data from Firestore collections using `getDocs()` or real-time hooks wrapping `onSnapshot`.
  - Mutations → Perform database operations (add, update, delete) in Firestore.
- Firestore offline persistence must be configured at the app level.

---

### 7. State Management (Zustand Only for Client State)

Use Zustand ONLY for client-side state:

- UI/Auth State (e.g., current active session info / loading status)
- User preferences & settings
- Theme mode (dark/light)
- Offline state indicator

**DO NOT use Zustand for Firestore database state.** All database collections/documents must be fetched and cached via TanStack Query.

---

### 8. Forms

Use:
- React Hook Form
- Zod validation

Example use cases:
- Add/Edit expense
- Create/Edit budget
- Authentication forms (handled in the unified auth screen)

---

### 9. AI Integration (Core Feature)

The app includes AI features such as:
- Categorizing expenses automatically
- Spending insights
- Monthly financial summary
- Budget recommendations

Rules:
- AI calls must be abstracted in `services/aiService.ts`.
- Never call AI endpoints directly in UI components.
- Cache AI responses to avoid redundant computations/costs.

---

### 10. Performance Rules

Always:
- Use `FlatList` or `SectionList` for transaction/expense lists.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `React.memo` for expensive list items or charts.
- Use `useCallback`/`useMemo` correctly.
- Optimize images via Expo Image.

---

### 11. UI/UX Rules

- Mobile-first design.
- Support tablet layouts.
- Always include:
  - loading state
  - empty state
  - error state
- Use `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` for all UI elements.
- Consistent theming with light/dark mode support.

Expense dashboard must include:
- Total balance
- Monthly income/expense chart
- Category breakdown
- Recent transactions

---

### 12. Security & Database Rules

- Use Firebase Authentication to secure user accounts.
- **Firestore Security Rules:** Ensure database access is restricted so users can only read and write their own documents.
- Keep Firestore collection schemas strict using TypeScript types.
- Never hardcode Firebase config secrets. Use `.env` or Expo Constants where appropriate.
- Store sensitive local tokens or identifiers only in Expo Secure Store.

---

### 13. Navigation

Use Expo Router file-based routing:
- `app/(auth)` → Authentication flow (unified login/signup with tab toggle)
- `app/(tabs)` → Main dashboard and settings screens
  - `app/(tabs)/index` → Home Dashboard
  - `app/(tabs)/scan` → Receipt Scanner
  - `app/(tabs)/analytics` → Analytics
  - `app/(tabs)/budget` → Budgets
  - `app/(tabs)/settings` → Settings
- `app/expense/[id]` → Expense detail view

---

### 14. Firebase Service Design Pattern

All database and auth logic must follow this structure in `services/`:

```
services/
├── authService.ts      # Firebase Auth methods (login, signup, logout)
├── expenseService.ts   # Firestore expense collection methods
├── budgetService.ts    # Firestore budget collection methods
└── aiService.ts        # AI backend interactions
```

Example Firestore Query Service Pattern:
```typescript
// services/expenseService.ts
import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';
import { Expense } from '@/types/expense';

export const expenseService = {
  getExpenses: async (userId: string): Promise<Expense[]> => {
    const snapshot = await firestore()
      .collection('expenses')
      .where('userId', '==', userId)
      .orderBy('date', 'desc')
      .get();
      
    return snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    })) as Expense[];
  },
  
  addExpense: async (userId: string, expenseData: Omit<Expense, 'id'>): Promise<string> => {
    const docRef = await firestore()
      .collection('expenses')
      .add({ ...expenseData, userId, createdAt: firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp() });
    return docRef.id;
  }
};
```

---

### 15. Error Handling

Every feature must handle:
- Firebase Auth and Firestore errors (e.g., authentication failures, permission issues, network disconnects).
- Empty states (when a user has no expenses or budgets).
- Offline states (using Firestore caching seamlessly).
- Form validation errors.

Never crash UI silently.

---

### 16. Onboarding & Auth Flow

- **Onboarding:** 3-slide carousel (Receipt Scanning, Analytics, AI Insights) with Skip button. Remember onboarding completion in Async Storage.
- **Auth:** Unified login/signup screen with tab toggle (`AuthToggle`) and reusable text inputs (`AuthTextInput`).
- Both use `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` for consistency.

---

### 17. Expo Workflow Rules

Default:
- Expo Managed Workflow utilizing **Expo Development Builds (`expo-dev-client`)** instead of Expo Go.
- Use EAS Build (`eas build`) to generate the native runtime needed for `@react-native-firebase` packages.

---

### 18. Code Generation Rules

When generating code:
1. Always use `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` for all UI components.
2. Explain the Firestore/Firebase architecture briefly.
3. Provide full TypeScript-typed implementation.
4. Show the project structure changes if adding a new feature.
5. Mention trade-offs (e.g., Firestore pagination, real-time vs. one-time fetching).
6. Provide production performance optimization tips.
7. Ensure components are reusable and decoupled.
